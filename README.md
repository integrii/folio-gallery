## Overview
folioGallery is an easy to use gallery written by Harry G of foliopages.com.  Just drop it on your PHP web server and edit the ``folio-gallery.php`` file to point the ``$mainFolder`` variable to the location of your pictures you want hosted.  If you are like me, this makes it super easy to turn your pile of home pictures into a browsable website in just a few minutes!

## DISCLAIMER

I did not create this!  [See the original project from foliopages.com here](http://www.foliopages.com/php-jquery-ajax-photo-gallery-no-database).


## Improvements
### Scale
When you have hundreds (or thousands) of page numbers, they would line up off the window and be unclickable.  This makes sure that does not happen anymore.
### Pagination
Pages are now shown as numbers instead of circle images
